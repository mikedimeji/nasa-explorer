Features
Browse photos taken by NASA's Curiosity Rover.
Select Martian days (Sols) using a slider to view photos from different days.
Responsive design for both mobile and desktop views.
Backend fetches data from NASA’s Mars Rover API and serves it to the frontend.
Error handling and loading states implemented for smooth user experience.

Architecture
This project follows a modern modular architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability. The application consists of two main parts:

Frontend (React)
Components are organized into reusable pieces.
Services handle all API requests, abstracting away external calls.
Hooks can be added for state and side-effect management.
Styles are maintained separately for easy customization.
Backend (Node.js/Express)
Controllers manage API requests, sending responses to the frontend.
Services handle the business logic (e.g., fetching Mars Rover photos from NASA’s API).
Routes define the API endpoints used by the frontend.

Tech Stack
Frontend:
React.js - Library for building user interfaces.
rc-slider - Library for adding the Sol slider.
Jest & React Testing Library - Unit and integration testing.
Backend:
Node.js & Express - Backend framework to handle API requests.
Axios - For making HTTP requests to NASA's API.
Jest - For unit testing backend services.


Prerequisites
Before running this application, make sure you have:

Node.js (>=14.x) and npm installed.
NASA API Key for accessing the Mars Rover API. Get it here.

Here is a sample README.md template that covers all the necessary sections for a well-documented full-stack React and Node.js application. It's tailored for your app that displays Mars Rover photos, following the structure we discussed.

Mars Rover Photo Viewer
This project is a full-stack application that fetches Mars Rover photos using NASA's API. The frontend is built with React, while the backend uses Node.js and Express for serving API requests. The app allows users to browse photos taken by NASA's Mars rovers for different Martian days (Sols).
